The game will start with players joining a waiting lobby to compete in a league. Once the waiting lobby has a minimum of 10 people a timer will start for 12 hours, in which other people can join, or existing players can review their coins and build their portfolio. Once the time is over, the lobby will be locked and no other players can join the existing lobby. After that, another counter for 12 hrs will start, in which all the players can make changes to their portfolios. After that, the league will start and 7x24 hours later, we will compare to determine the winners.

Prize: 
	From all the buy-in money, we will distribute it to the winners. It will be distributed the following way: 

1% - 10% : 	get 20% of the pool - double the money
11% - 25% :	get 30% of the pool - around 1.5 the money
26% - 50% : 	get 50% of the pool - break even
50% - 100%: 	loose their buy-in coins



Exceptions to be considered: 

If a player gets <25 tokens(we are assuming that 25 is the least to participate in a league) we replenish it to 25 next week, allowing him to play again, but only after a week.
