Week 2 (Summary)

This week I had implemented the NEWS API for the Dashboard. This meant that I had to call the API from NEWSAPI.org and had to create an API of my own. 
This was something I had not done before and was really interested in learning and implementing. I had spent a lot of time learning and breaking the build
but in the end since everything worked and I learnt how to create an API, I was really happy with my progress.
